#Module load/unload

# list all loaded modules
lsmod

# load a module to kernel
insmod <path of module>

#remove a loaded module
rmmod

# load a module along with all dependencies
modprobe

###### KERNEL BASICS ######

# know current kernel being used
uname -a 

# just print kernel version
uname -r

# modules reside in /lib/modules

# Official location of kernel is kernel.org

# Extract a tar.xz file with linux to figure out extraction algorithm:
tar xf <file path>

# Commands for hardware info
lshw
lspci
lsusb
lsbk
lscpu
lsdev

# way to organize a command output in vim like format
<command> | less

# list of system calls is available in
<kernel cource>/include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h

# comand to count lines in a command output:
<command> | wc -l

# count lines in a file:
wc -l <file path>

# return value of sytem calls is -1 in case of errors and errno is set to corresponding error code.

## VIRTUAL FS ##

# know PID of the processes:
ps -l

# process directory is in /proc filesystem
/proc/<PID>

# executable being run in a PID is symlinked here:
/proc/<PID>/exe

# file descriptors of a processs are present here:
/proc/<PID>/fd/

# command to know device file of current window of terminal:
tty

# command to identify system calls summary of a <command>
strace -c <command>

# Command to check memory stats:
free

# command to enter root shell:
sudo bash

# print everything inside /proc filesystem in form of strings:
sudo sysctl -a

# create your own character device file (pickle) with major number 1 and minor number 2
mknod pickle c 1 2

## LOADABLE KERNEL MODULES ##

# To view line numbers in vim, type this:
:set number

# to view top entries of a command output:
<command> | head

# get latest loaded modules:
lsmod | head

# make a command run in background so that you can use the terminal:
gedit abc
ctrl + Z
bg
#to bring it to foreground:
fg

# all grub commands can be found through this command:
man -k grub

# commandline parameters of kernel are set in this file:
/proc/cmdline

# to find location of a command:
which <command>

# To find type of file
file <path>
